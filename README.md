# LeaguePlayerCardGenerator

welcome to my first website project made with gihub in mind!

As a Cs student, web developer and League player I decided to combine my interests into one simple github project.

This website allows anybody to check basic statistics about theire League account useing freely avaliable api keys given to anybody that creates riot developer account

simpely create a developer account copy ur api key paste it into the website together with server and nick name of player you want to find statistics of and you good to go!

The app fetches information about the account from riot games server and displays current win ratio, rank and League Points (LP) in three different modes.

This project has massive potential when it comes to new features so I am open for anybody to submit theire ideas and changes.
