# LeaguePlayerCardGenerator

welcome to my first website project made with github in mind!

As a Cs student, web developer and League player I decided to combine my interests into one simple github project.

This website allows anybody to check basic statistics about their League account useing freely avaliable api keys given to anybody who creates riot developer account.

simply create a developer account, copy your api key, paste it into the website together with server and nick name of a player you want to find the statistics of and you are good to go!

The app fetches information about the account from riot games server and displays current win ratio, rank and League Points (LP) in four different modes.

This project has a massive potential when it comes to new features so I am open for anybody to submit their ideas and changes.

!!! - I updated the code to support the new structure of riots apis useing RiotID to get puuid istead of summonername but the CORS problem doesnt allow my hosting address: https://adappstudio.co.uk/Filip/LPCG/  to use the api. With that beeing said I have double checked the requests and they are working so the code itself should be functional.
